1\. Abstract
------------

The **Goal-Oriented Application Specification Language (GO-ASL)** defines a structured, machine-readable DSL for instructing large language models (LLMs) to produce application code, configurations, and deployment artifacts. Unlike specification-heavy DSLs that require detailed architectural inputs, GO-ASL focuses on expressing **high-level goals, constraints, and principles**, allowing LLMs to act as intelligent software architects and generate complete applications end-to-end.

2\. Introduction
----------------

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of generating production-quality software systems. However, unstructured natural language prompts are often ambiguous, leading to misinterpretations, missing requirements, or architectures unsuitable for real-world deployment.

GO-ASL provides a **standardized format** to capture:

*   the purpose of the application
    
*   required and prohibited technologies
    
*   non-functional requirements (NFRs)
    
*   architectural and design principles
    
*   constraints on deployment, security, and compliance
    

The specification ensures consistent communication between developers and LLMs, enabling reproducibility and higher confidence in generated software artifacts.

3\. Motivation
--------------

Several challenges exist with LLM-based software generation:

*   Developers often omit critical NFRs like security, performance, or compliance.
    
*   LLMs generate divergent outputs due to prompt ambiguities.
    
*   Professional teams require control over coding standards, architecture patterns, and dependencies.
    
*   Industry-grade systems must comply with privacy and regulatory requirements.
    
*   Observability and error handling are frequently neglected in AI-generated code.
    

GO-ASL aims to bridge this gap by acting as a **contract** between the developer and the LLM, clarifying both **what** should be built and **how** it should adhere to software engineering best practices.

4\. Design Goals
----------------

GO-ASL was designed to:

*   Be **goal-centric**, not architecture-centric.
    
*   Support minimal inputs for rapid prototyping.
    
*   Allow precise constraints for enterprise-grade systems.
    
*   Be human-readable (YAML syntax).
    
*   Provide sufficient information for LLMs to reason and plan before generating code.
    
*   Support iterative conversations and refinements between human developers and LLMs.
    

5\. Syntax Overview
-------------------

A GO-ASL document is written in YAML and consists of optional and required sections.

Top-level format:

````yaml
goal:
  ...

constraints:
  ...

preferences:
  ...

principles:
  ...

non_functional_requirements:
  ...

observability:
  ...

reasoning:
  ...

dependencies:
  ...

code_quality:
  ...

internationalization:
  ...

environments:
  ...

data_privacy:
  ...

documentation:
  ...
````

Except for goal, all sections are optional.

6\. Section Definitions
-----------------------

### 6.1 goal

**Required.** Defines the purpose and high-level functionality of the desired application.

**Fields:**

*   name: Short name of the application.
    
*   description: Natural language explanation of core functionality.
    

**Example:**

````yaml
goal:
  name: TaskMaster API
  description: >
    A RESTful API for managing personal tasks. Users can register,
    log in, and create, read, update, or delete tasks. Each task
    has a title, description, due date, and completion status.

````

### 6.2 constraints

Specifies **non-negotiable requirements.**

*   must\_use\_technologies: List of required technologies.
    
*   must\_not\_use\_technologies: List of forbidden technologies.
    
*   deployment\_target: E.g. docker-compose, kubernetes, serverless.
    
*   scale: low | medium | high.
    
*   budget: low | medium | high.
    
*   licensing: open-source | proprietary.
    

**Example:**

````yaml
constraints:
  must_use_technologies:
    - Java
  must_not_use_technologies:
    - JavaScript
  deployment_target: docker-compose
  scale: low
  budget: low

7\. Usage Flow with LLMs
------------------------

A typical workflow:

1.  Developer writes a GO-ASL spec.
    
2.  LLM reads the spec.
    
3.  LLM:
    
    *   Proposes architecture.
        
    *   Explains decisions (if reasoning enabled).
        
4.  Developer approves or modifies the plan.
    
5.  LLM generates:
    
    *   source code
        
    *   configurations
        
    *   deployment artifacts
        
6.  Developer iteratively refines outputs.

9\. Security Considerations
---------------------------

GO-ASL itself defines no executable behavior and thus poses no direct security risks. However:

*   LLMs interpreting GO-ASL must sanitize outputs to avoid injection vulnerabilities.
    
*   Sensitive data in specs (e.g. database URLs) should not be committed to public repositories.
    

10\. Future Work
----------------

Potential future improvements:

*   Formal schemas for validating GO-ASL documents.
    
*   Standard vocabularies for common app goals.
    
*   Integration with IDE plugins for GO-ASL editing.
    
*   Tooling for converting GO-ASL to model-specific prompts automatically.
    
*   Multi-model compatibility guidelines.
